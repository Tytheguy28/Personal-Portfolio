      <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
        <p>My passion for Software Engineering started in Highschool. In my junior year, my teacher asked me "What aspirations will I follow after Highschool?" I said "Software Engineering". I wanted to gain more skills and get as much exposure as possible without going to college, taking the extra classes that I didn't need, and paying so much in tuition. Also, I want to show my willingness to work with a team full of developers as well as taking constructive criticism to make coding easier for me to read as well as others editing the same things. Thinkful gave me that opportunity to elevate and capitalize from the program as a student enrolled in the Software Engineering flex course.</p>
        <p>Outside of Software Engineering, I have other interests that I believe to be having a good time. My interests are watching/playing sports, working out, stocks, and surfing the web.</p>
